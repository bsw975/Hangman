Create a word-guess game, often called hangman. The object is to choose letters that will appear in the word without choosing too many wrong letters. The man in the noose is drawn in 5-10 steps, once for each wrong letter. Guess the word correctly before the man is hanged!

Pseudocoding's first assignment. An attempt to strategize on how code is to be put in place. Choose variable and function names with an idea of how they will be used. Set the flow of the code so that there is a good chance that entire blocks of code will need to be typed only once, and need very little debugging.

With a basic-to-solid knowledge of JavaScript, and without using jQuery, the goal was set in a couple of steps. First, getting the JavaScript logic and flow to work in the console, or without working to interact on-the-fly with the html webpage. Second, moving that functionality from user-hidden to user-visible.

There was an attempt to make dry the identifiers ("id"s) of the html tags/spans, that represent each letter. For the sake of time, they were hardcoded, ten each for blank letters and missed letters.

some of the game logic appears within the main 'onkeyup' function, with the rest being called by functions. Written by a developer with limited knowledge of the difference between what could be done and what should be done, the code appears haphazard. But function names are descriptive and intuitive, and variables are used effectively in a way that allows the code to be quickly parsed.

Overall effectiveness is satisfying, and shows a ready grasp of the kind of interaction allowed by JavaScript.
